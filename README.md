⚠️ **This project is a development preview.** Expect breaking changes before a stable release.

🌎 Our [Live Demo](https://demo.werkyn.com/) is online! Check it out!

📚 Read the [Werkyn Documentation](https://www.werkyn.com/docs) for more information and features.


## Getting Started
For local testing and development. Expect breaking changes before a stable release. There may be security flaws in the current state. Do not use in production. This will require **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/werkyn/werkyn.git
cd werkyn
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This builds the app image, starts PostgreSQL, runs database migrations, and launches the server.

- **App**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Mailpit** (email testing UI): `http://localhost:8025`

## Features

### Project Management

**Kanban Boards** - Visual task management with customizable status columns

## Project Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo with three packages:

```
werkyn/
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/      # Zod schemas, TypeScript types, and constants
│   ├── backend/     # Fastify HTTP/WebSocket server with Prisma
│   └── frontend/    # React SPA with Vite
├── package.json     # Root workspace configuration
└── tsconfig.base.json
```

### Architecture
- **Backend modules** follow routes → controller → service layering
- **Authorization** resolves workspace context from route params
- **Real-time events** broadcast via WebSocket subscriptions
- **Frontend features** organized into feature folders with `api.ts`, `components/`, and `hooks/`

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** - Latest React with modern features
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **TanStack Router** - Type-safe file-based routing
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management
- **Zustand** - Client state management
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling
- **Mantine UI** - Component library
- **BlockNote** - Rich text editor
- **FullCalendar** - Calendar component
- **dnd-kit** - Drag and drop functionality

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Fastify 5** - Fast web framework
- **Prisma** - Type-safe ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **WebSocket** - Real-time communication
- **JWT** - Authentication
- **Zod** - Schema validation

### Infrastructure
- **pnpm Workspaces** - Monorepo package management
- **TypeScript** - Type safety across the stack
- **Docker Compose** - Single-command containerized deployment


## Local Development

For contributors who want to run outside of Docker:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** >= 20.0.0
- **pnpm** >= 9.0.0
- **Docker** (for PostgreSQL and Mailpit)

### Setup

1. Start the infrastructure services:
```bash
docker compose up postgres mailpit
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cd packages/backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database connection and other settings
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
cd packages/backend
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed  # Optional: seed with sample data
```

5. Start development servers:
```bash
# From the root directory
pnpm dev
```

This will start both the backend and frontend in development mode:
- Backend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
